Cryptograhy is the art of communication between two users via coded message.
           -Emerged with the basic motive of providing security to confidential messages transferred 
            from one party to another.
           -the art and science of concealing the message to introduce privacy and secrecy as recognized in information security.
           
           
           terminologies  of cryptography
           ----------------------------
           plain text - text which is readable and can be understood by all  users
           cipher text - optained after applying cryptography on plain text.
           encryption - converted plain text to cipher text. also encoding 
           decryption - coverting cipher text to plain text also decoding.
           
           
           characteristics of modern cryptography
           =======================================
 -operate on bit sequences
 -used mathematical algorithms for securing the information
 -Requires parties interested in secure communication channel to acheive privacy.
 
 Double string encryption 
 ----------------------------
 -also called multiple encryption/cascade  encryption/cascade ciphering 
 -Encrypting an already encrypted text one  or more times
  with the same or differrent algorithm/pattern
  
  levels of double strength encryption
  ----------------------------------------
  -first layer of encryption - the cipher text is generated from the original readable message
                               using hash algorithm and symmetric keys.
                             -Symmetric key are encrypted with the help of asymmetric keys.
                             -combining the hash digest of the cipher text into a capsule is 
                              the best illustration for this pattern.
                              
                              
 -second layer of encryption - 
                                -add  one more layer to cipher text with same or different algorithm.
                                -usually , a 32-bit character long symmetric password is used for the same.
                                
                                
Third layer of encryption
                            -The encrypted capsule is transmitted via SSL/TLS connection
                            to the communication partner.
                            -capsule create for transmission.
